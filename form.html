	<h2>Fix Segue Archive CSS</h2>
	<p>Segue HTML archives exported before Monday, August 6, 2012 include a small path error that prevents them from being successfully served from cr.middlebury.edu (though they look fine when opened from your desktop). This error results in no page style being applied to the site when viewed in Firefox or Chrome (the site looks fine in Internet Explorer).</p>
	
	<p>Upload a Segue archive file in the form below and you will be prompted to download a fixed version.</p>
	<form action='' method='post' enctype="multipart/form-data">
		<input type="file" name="archive"/>
		<input type="submit" value="Upload"/>
	</form>
